# Dog_breeds_DL
This is a educational project.
In order to discover deep learning (CNN from scratch and transfer learning), I have to build a model, which can predict a dog breed from an image.
This repository contains the CNN built thanks to transfer learning (Xception, F. Chollet). It reaches 90% accuracy (test set).
My CNN from scratch is not uploaded, because of its lower accuracy ^^'.
