# Dog_breeds_DL
In order to discover deep learning (CNN from scratch and transfer learning), I have to build a CNN, which can predict a dog breed from an image.

The dataset used can be found here: http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/

This CNN was built thanks to transfer learning (Xception, F. Chollet).

The application can be found here: https://gradio.app/g/GaetanPelletier/Dog_breeds_DL
